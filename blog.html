                            <h3>Full Blog</h3>
                            <p>The first week of my internship was all about getting to know the project, setting
                                expectations, and planning the work ahead.
                                It was a crucial phase where we established a solid foundation for the upcoming
                                weeks.</p>

                            <h3>Meeting with the Mentor</h3>
                            <p>To kick off the internship, we had an in-depth discussion with our mentor about the
                                project. We covered key aspects such as:<br><br>
                                - Who is responsible for which tasks <br>
                                - The mentor’s vision for the project <br>
                                - The necessary deliverables and deadlines <br>
                                - The available resources and tools <br><br>
                                This meeting gave us a clear understanding of what needs to be done and how we will
                                collaborate as a team.
                            </p>


                            <h3>Meeting with the Supervisor</h3>
                            <p>Following our initial discussion, we had a formal meeting with both our mentor and
                                the project supervisor.<br>
                                This was essential to align our work with the expectations and requirements set by
                                the supervisor. We discussed:<br><br>

                                - The project scope and objectives <br>
                                - Key deadlines and milestones <br>
                                - The necessary criteria our internship work must meet <br><br>

                                Having this clarity from both the mentor and supervisor ensured that we were on the
                                right track from the start.</p>

                            <h3>Assessing Resources and Planning the Setup</h3>
                            <p>After the meetings, we took a hands-on approach by physically inspecting the
                                available resources. This allowed us to:<br><br>

                                - Identify the tools and equipment we can use <br>
                                - Determine what additional resources are needed <br>
                                - Discuss with fellow interns how we will set up everything <br><br>

                                By the end of the week, we had a clear plan for the physical setup and a structured
                                approach for the weeks ahead.</p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>This first week was all about preparation, communication, and organization.
                                Understanding the project’s goals, available resources, and team roles has given us
                                a strong start.
                                With everything now in place, I am looking forward to diving into the actual work in
                                the coming weeks!</p>

                            <p>This week at my internship has been both educational and hands-on, providing me with
                                valuable insights into SD-WAN technologies and real-world deployments.</p>

                            <h3>Monday – Self-Study</h3>
                            <p>Since I will be attending a three-day course next week on SD-WAN technologies and
                                deployments, I first had to prepare myself by completing the SD-WAN Essentials
                                course. I spent the entire Monday studying the fundamentals to ensure I had a solid
                                understanding before the training sessions. This self-study session covered key
                                topics such as:<br><br>

                                - The benefits of SD-WAN over traditional WAN solutions <br>
                                - How SD-WAN simplifies network management and improves performance <br>
                                - Security considerations in SD-WAN deployments <br>
                                - Different architectures and deployment models <br><br>

                                It was a lot of information to absorb in one day, but it gave me a strong foundation
                                for the upcoming training sessions.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Tuesday – Hands-On Lab Work</h3>
                            <p>Tuesday was all about practical experience. Together with my fellow interns, I worked
                                in the lab to set up and configure two Aruba EC-L-H appliances in preparation for
                                their deployment in a production environment.<br><br>

                                Our tasks included:<br><br>

                                - Installing the necessary software and updates on the appliances <br>
                                - Configuring basic network settings to ensure connectivity <br>
                                - Testing the appliances in a controlled lab environment <br>
                                - Cleaning and organizing the lab to maintain an efficient workspace <br><br>

                                This hands-on session helped reinforce the theoretical knowledge I had gained the
                                day before. Working directly with the hardware and troubleshooting configurations
                                gave me a much clearer understanding of how SD-WAN solutions are implemented in
                                real-world scenarios.

                                environment. This was a crucial step, as it required us to ensure that everything
                                was properly installed and functioning without disrupting existing network
                                operations.<br><br>

                                During the deployment, we:<br><br>

                                - Physically installed the Aruba EC-L-H appliances in their designated locations
                                <br>
                                - Connected them to the network and verified connectivity <br>
                                - Finalized and fine-tuned the configurations to ensure seamless operation <br>
                                - Conducted tests to confirm stability and performance <br><br>

                                Additionally, we documented the entire setup process by creating a detailed network
                                diagram and writing comprehensive installation and configuration documentation. This
                                documentation will be useful for future troubleshooting, maintenance, and reference
                                by other team members.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>This week has been a great mix of theoretical learning and practical experience.
                                Studying SD-WAN Essentials gave me the foundational knowledge I needed, while

                            <h3>Full Blog</h3>
                            <p>This week was all about planning, approvals, and fine-tuning configurations. From
                                reviewing our progress to setting up a lab environment and getting official approvals,
                                it was a structured and productive week.</p>

                            <h3>Monday – Reflection & Review</h3>
                            <p>We started the week with a team meeting where we reviewed everything we had worked on so
                                far. Together with my two colleagues, we discussed our progress, identified priorities,
                                and outlined what still needed to be done. This helped us set clear goals for the
                                upcoming weeks. Additionally, we went through all existing configurations, carefully
                                checking if everything was set up correctly. It was a great opportunity to ensure that
                                we were aligned and that our configurations met the necessary requirements.</p>

                            <h3>Tuesday – Official Approvals & Lab Setup</h3>
                            <p>Since we’re working within a defense environment, everything we implement must go through
                                official approval processes. On Tuesday, we met with our internship supervisor to go
                                over the necessary security and authorization steps. In this environment, we can’t just
                                configure and deploy as we please—every change needs to be reviewed and approved through
                                the proper channels to ensure security compliance.</p>

                            <p>After mapping out all the required approvals and security checks, we shifted our focus to
                                setting up the lab environment. Alongside our production setup, we now have a dedicated
                                lab where we can safely test and practice before making changes in the live environment.
                                This will be invaluable for troubleshooting and validating configurations before
                                deployment.</p>

                            <h3>Thursday – Configurations & Lab Refinements</h3>
                            <p>By Thursday, several of our approval requests had been processed and approved, allowing
                                us to move forward with configuring the appliances. We continued refining our lab
                                environment, making sure it mirrored the production setup as closely as possible. This
                                will allow us to test new configurations safely before applying them in a real-world
                                setting.</p>

                            <p>With both the lab and production environments coming together, we now have a structured
                                workflow for testing, approving, and deploying configurations efficiently. It was a
                                satisfying way to wrap up the week, knowing we had laid the groundwork for smoother
                                implementations moving forward.</p>

                            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                            <p>This week emphasized the importance of structured planning and official approval
                                processes in a highly regulated environment. It also reinforced the value of having a
                                dedicated lab setup for testing and refining configurations before they go live. With
                                our environments now properly set up, I’m looking forward to continuing our work and
                                applying what we’ve learned in a controlled and secure manner.</p>
