                                <h3>Full Blog</h3>
                                <p>The first week of my internship was all about getting to know the project, setting
                                    expectations, and planning the work ahead.
                                    It was a crucial phase where we established a solid foundation for the upcoming
                                    weeks.</p>

                                <h3>Meeting with the Mentor</h3>
                                <p>To kick off the internship, we had an in-depth discussion with our mentor about the
                                    project. We covered key aspects such as:<br><br>
                                    - Who is responsible for which tasks <br>
                                    - The mentorâ€™s vision for the project <br>
                                    - The necessary deliverables and deadlines <br>
                                    - The available resources and tools <br><br>
                                    This meeting gave us a clear understanding of what needs to be done and how we will
                                    collaborate as a team.
                                </p>


                                <h3>Meeting with the Supervisor</h3>
                                <p>Following our initial discussion, we had a formal meeting with both our mentor and
                                    the project supervisor.<br>
                                    This was essential to align our work with the expectations and requirements set by
                                    the supervisor. We discussed:<br><br>

                                    - The project scope and objectives <br>
                                    - Key deadlines and milestones <br>
                                    - The necessary criteria our internship work must meet <br><br>

                                    Having this clarity from both the mentor and supervisor ensured that we were on the
                                    right track from the start.</p>

                                <h3>Assessing Resources and Planning the Setup</h3>
                                <p>After the meetings, we took a hands-on approach by physically inspecting the
                                    available resources. This allowed us to:<br><br>

                                    - Identify the tools and equipment we can use <br>
                                    - Determine what additional resources are needed <br>
                                    - Discuss with fellow interns how we will set up everything <br><br>

                                    By the end of the week, we had a clear plan for the physical setup and a structured
                                    approach for the weeks ahead.</p>

                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>This first week was all about preparation, communication, and organization.
                                    Understanding the projectâ€™s goals, available resources, and team roles has given us
                                    a strong start.
                                    With everything now in place, I am looking forward to diving into the actual work in
                                    the coming weeks!</p>

                                    deployments, I first had to prepare myself by completing the SD-WAN Essentials
                                    course. I spent the entire Monday studying the fundamentals to ensure I had a solid
                                    understanding before the training sessions. This self-study session covered key
                                    topics such as:<br><br>

                                    - The benefits of SD-WAN over traditional WAN solutions <br>
                                    - How SD-WAN simplifies network management and improves performance <br>
                                    - Security considerations in SD-WAN deployments <br>
                                    - Different architectures and deployment models <br><br>

                                    It was a lot of information to absorb in one day, but it gave me a strong foundation
                                    for the upcoming training sessions.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Tuesday â€“ Hands-On Lab Work</h3>
                                <p>Tuesday was all about practical experience. Together with my fellow interns, I worked
                                    in the lab to set up and configure two Aruba EC-L-H appliances in preparation for
                                    their deployment in a production environment.<br><br>

                                    Our tasks included:<br><br>

                                    - Installing the necessary software and updates on the appliances <br>
                                    - Configuring basic network settings to ensure connectivity <br>
                                    - Testing the appliances in a controlled lab environment <br>
                                    - Cleaning and organizing the lab to maintain an efficient workspace <br><br>

                                    This hands-on session helped reinforce the theoretical knowledge I had gained the
                                    day before. Working directly with the hardware and troubleshooting configurations
                                    gave me a much clearer understanding of how SD-WAN solutions are implemented in
                                    real-world scenarios.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Thursday â€“ Deployment in a Production Environment</h3>
                                <p>Thursday was one of the most exciting days of the week because we took our
                                    configurations from the lab and deployed the appliances in a live production
                                    environment. This was a crucial step, as it required us to ensure that everything
                                    was properly installed and functioning without disrupting existing network
                                    operations.<br><br>

                                    During the deployment, we:<br><br>

                                    - Physically installed the Aruba EC-L-H appliances in their designated locations
                                    <br>
                                    - Connected them to the network and verified connectivity <br>
                                    - Finalized and fine-tuned the configurations to ensure seamless operation <br>
                                    - Conducted tests to confirm stability and performance <br><br>

                                    Additionally, we documented the entire setup process by creating a detailed network
                                    diagram and writing comprehensive installation and configuration documentation. This
                                    documentation will be useful for future troubleshooting, maintenance, and reference
                                    by other team members.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>This week has been a great mix of theoretical learning and practical experience.
                                    Studying SD-WAN Essentials gave me the foundational knowledge I needed, while
                                    working in the lab and deploying real appliances helped me understand the challenges
                                    and best practices involved in network implementations.<br><br>
